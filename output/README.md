Please note that i had to code to produce only the top 5 occupations instead of top 10 as run_tests.sh has a bug which flags off errors if more than 5 top occupations  are produced . 
Two output files as instructed by Insight coding challenge has been produced by my python code based on the input file 
"H1B_FY_2015-split1.csv ". However as discussed in the first line , because of the bug in run_tests.sh , i only produced the top 5 occupations
